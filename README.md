# backupCopyAndMove 28/04/2020

This was a script that was created for my final project in scripting for a Linux class during my Cisco IoT course.

The main idea for this script is to create a backup of one file and save it into a different location although you can also save the script itself 
There's a simple menu system implemented within, ranging from options;
1. Backup Script File - This backs up the current script file and ammends the date and time to it.
2. Info - Takes information of the host and prints it to a text file named log_dir. Saves who, whostname, path, whoami and date. Saves file with date and time on the end.
3. Copy - Asks for name of file to copy and directory to move file to.
4. Move - Asks for name of file to move and asks for directory for file to be moved to.
Q. Quit - Self explanatory
